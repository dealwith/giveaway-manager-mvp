# Project-Specific Rules for Giveaway Manager

## Internationalization (i18n)

- ALWAYS use translations for all user-facing text in components
- Import `useTranslations` from "next-intl" in client components
- Add corresponding translation keys to all language files in `/messages/` folder
- Translation files: en.json, es.json, pl.json, ru.json, ua.json
- Use semantic translation keys (e.g., "instagram.connect.title" not "connectInstagramTitle")

## Code Style

- NEVER use `any` type in TypeScript - always use proper types, interfaces, or union types
- Use strict typing for all variables, function parameters, and return values
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')

## Workflow

- Be sure to typecheck when you're done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- Don't add comments in the code
- Ensure compatibility of code and features with package.json version of the packages when adding new code

## Commits

- Don't add information that the code was generated by the AI to the commit messages
- If there is more than one commited file, you should analyze every file and what was done there
